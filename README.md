# WeatherWear

## Introduction

A JavaScript web app that helps users decide what to wear when they go out depending on the current weather forecast. Whilst out users can look up local places to eat.

## Description

User's enter their location and use the drop down menus to select what time they are going out and what time they are coming home. WeatherWear will fetch the local weather information for the selected time period and find the average temperature.
